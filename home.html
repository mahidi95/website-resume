      <p class="text">At Drexel University I have completed their 5 year undergraduate degree program from the College of Engineering, from which I graduated with a BS in Materials Science and Engineering. I was very active on campus outside of academics. I was a resident assistant (RA) for 4 years, during which I gained many valuable and transferable skills such as strong communication and interpersonal skills. Additionally, I was involved in doing undergraduate research in which I worked with various carbon materials for supercapacitor applications. My time at Drexel was very unique and I am greatful for all of the experiences and opportunities I received from this great institution.</p>

                <p class="text">As part of the Drexel co-op program, I worked at Estee Lauder in the Quality Engineering department. I got a chance to identify failures and failure modes on manual and automated assembly lines. I worked with brands such as MAC, Clinique, and Smashbox. And before you ask, NO I did not receive unlimited free samples of products! </p>

                <p class="text">At Stryker, I also worked in the Quality Engineering Department. At this co-op, I got experience in the documentation side of QA. I worked with several different spinal instrumentation product files – I updated the DOE files and made sure all risks associated with product use was being captured. I even got a chance to see a cadaver when I attended a product validation lab! Dead bodies do not smell very good…</p>

                <p class="text">At Drexel University, I got a chance to be a Resident Assistant (RA) for 4 years! I must say it was my favorite part of my Drexel undergraduate career. I learned many valuable and transferrable skills such as working in group settings, interpersonal skills, and communication skills. I love being a mentor and this opportunity gave me a chance to help high school graduates with their transition to college.</p>

                <p class="text">I never drank much coffee until I started working at Saxbys. Seeking to expand my talents, I decided to become a barista! I learned so much about coffee and expresso (not EXpresso) drinks that I did not know before. I am also now less confused when I walk into Starbucks and see drinks like the caramel macchiato and cinnamon dolce latte!</p>

                    <p class="text">In high school, I ran track and played football (believe it or not). More recently, I started playing a lot of basketball. Being relatively short (5’3.75” if you were wondering), I need to compensate for my height in speed and agility! I also will occasionally play soccer and volleyball but basketball is my go-to sport.</p>

                    <p class="text">I love reading fantasy books but I decided I should widen my genre range – I now also enjoy non-fiction books. My favorite series is the Kingkiller Chronicles! They are basically a better (in my opinion) version of Harry Potter. Elon Musk is my idol and I wish to be as amazing as him one day! I highly recommend Ashlee Vance’s biography that he wrote about Elon.</p>

I can study to it, game to it, or even sleep to it! I am also teaching myself how to DJ! No matter how busy I am in life, I love learning new things and seeking out opportunities to expose myself to something I have never tried before.</p>
